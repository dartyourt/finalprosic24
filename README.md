# DeonScalp: Web Deteksi Penyakit Kulit Kepala
This project aims to develop an IoT and AI-based scalp disease detection system using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system will collect scalp image data using a camera activated by a LIDAR sensor and a buzzer, then analyze the data using machine learning to provide diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

We are so sorry, The APP could only run locally!
> It needs to access the camera hardware so we cannot deploy the Web App publicly

## DISCLAIMER 

you have to installed some libraries needed:

+ cv2
+ firebase
+ firebase-admin
+ streamlit
+ google.generativeai
+ tensorflow

etc...

## HOW TO RUN
1. In fact, it is just simply by running the Web App code named **streamlitv2.py**
2. But, you have to installed some libraries needed cuz it will run locally in your computer
3. You have to download the credentials.json -- i already give the link to drive in Web App folder
4. Download the model named **scalp_condition_classifier_model.h5** you can found it in Models folder
