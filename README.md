# DeonScalp: Web Deteksi Penyakit Kulit Kepala
This project aims to develop an IoT and AI-based scalp disease detection system using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system will collect scalp image data using a camera activated by a LIDAR sensor and a buzzer, then analyze the data using machine learning to provide diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

We are so sorry, The APP could only run locally!
> It needs to access the camera hardware so we cannot deploy the Web App publicly

## DISCLAIMER 

you have to installed some libraries needed:

+ cv2
+ firebase
+ firebase-admin
+ streamlit
+ google.generativeai
+ tensorflow

etc...

## HOW TO RUN
1. Ensure the required libraries are installed, as the application will run locally on your computer.
2. Download the credentials.json file from the link provided in the Web App folder.
3. Download the model named scalp_condition_classifier_model.h5, which can be found in the Models folder.
4. Now, you can run the Web App code named **streamlitv2.py.**
5. Enjoy!
